# Sors Maxima - Quantum Sports Betting Intelligence

## Overview
Sors Maxima is a quantum-powered sports betting intelligence platform designed to help users construct more intelligent parlays. It provides coherence scores, pattern recognition, and quantum-optimized predictions using advanced probability analysis, correlation modeling, and optimal stake sizing. The project aims to provide a competitive edge in the sports betting market through data-driven decision-making.

## System Architecture
The application uses a modern web architecture with a React-based frontend and an Express.js backend, both written in TypeScript. UI components are built using TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui, with state management handled by TanStack Query and routing by Wouter.

The core features include a Monte Carlo simulation engine for probability analysis, incorporating high-precision random number generation, variance reduction techniques, and Cholesky decomposition for correlation modeling. Optimal stake sizing is determined using an advanced Kelly Criterion implementation. Correlation modeling employs Gaussian copula-based methods.

Key features include:
- **Smart Ticket Generator & Visual Parlay Builder**: Automated and visual tools for constructing betting tickets with real-time data, confidence scores, and smart suggestions.
- **Betting Intelligence System**: Provides A-F grading for bets, EV indicators, risk advisories, and configurable betting environment presets.
- **Advanced Predictive Engines**: Includes a Continuous Learning Engine, Quantum Fusion Engine (integrating 46 factors across 7 categories), and Scheme Recognition Engine for adaptive and comprehensive analysis.
- **Pro Tools**: Offers advanced features like real-time odds comparison, ML prop projections, an advanced correlation engine, same-game parlay optimizer, bankroll simulator, and various calculators.
- **Live Center**: Provides real-time game monitoring, including a momentum tracker, live scheme recognition, and a cash-out advisor.
- **Admin Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards for user management, fraud detection, subscription statistics, model performance monitoring, data provenance, risk management, and financial projections.
- **Prediction Pipeline Engine**: A 12-module production-grade pipeline covering data ingestion, feature engineering, prediction, diversity, optimization, risk/compliance, verification, feedback, evaluation, monitoring, explainability, and data privacy.
- **Security Architecture**: Multi-layered security including security headers, IP blocking, input sanitization, rate limiting, session fingerprinting, password security, account lockout, and fraud detection.
- **AI Admin Assistant**: AI-powered operational intelligence dashboard (server/adminAssistantEngine.ts, /admin/assistant) that generates structured admin reports with prioritized tasks, financial/risk/compliance actions, budget plans, experiment suggestions, and operational checklists using OpenAI analysis of live platform data.
- **Growth & Operations Management**: Includes features like Trial Fraud Detection, A/B Test Manager, Lifecycle Campaign Manager, User Segmentation & Personalization, Promotional Offers Manager, Acquisition & CAC Analytics, and an advanced Orchestration System for platform governance and ticketing.
- **Analytics Agent Engine**: A behind-the-scenes real-time sports betting analytics agent (server/analyticsAgentEngine.ts) that continuously ingests ESPN live data, normalizes team names, validates feed health, computes market analysis (implied probabilities, EV, Kelly criterion, arbitrage detection, risk exposure, trend analysis), monitors model drift, and produces canonical JSON snapshots. Completely hidden from users; admin-controllable via `/api/admin/analytics-agent/*` endpoints (start/stop/restart/config/metrics/feeds/errors/markets/snapshots). Auto-starts on server boot.
